A pod is a collection of containers sharing a network and mount namespace
and is the basic unit of deployment in Kubernetes. All containers in a pod
are scheduled on the same node.

To launch a pod using the container [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/mhausenblas/simpleservice/)
`mhausenblas/simpleservice:0.5.0` and exposing a HTTP API on port `9876`, execute:

```bash
$ kubectl run sise --image=mhausenblas/simpleservice:0.5.0 --port=9876
```

We can now see that the pod is running:

```bash
$ kubectl get pods
NAME                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
sise-3210265840-k705b     1/1       Running   0          1m

$ kubectl describe pod sise-3210265840-k705b | grep IP:
IP:                     172.17.0.3
```

From within the cluster (e.g. via `minishift ssh`) this pod is accessible via the pod IP `172.17.0.3`,
which we've learned from the `kubectl describe` command above:

```bash
[cluster] $ curl 172.17.0.3:9876/info
{"host": "172.17.0.3:9876", "version": "0.5.0", "from": "172.17.0.1"}
```

Note that `kubectl run` creates a [deployment](/deployments/), so in order to
get rid of the pod you have to execute `kubectl delete deployment sise`.


#### Using configuration file

You can also create a pod from a configuration file.
In this case the [pod](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/master/specs/pods/pod.yaml) is
running the already known `simpleservice` image from above along with
a generic `CentOS` container:

```bash
$ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/master/specs/pods/pod.yaml

$ kubectl get pods
NAME                      READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
twocontainers             2/2       Running   0          7s
```

Now we can exec into the `CentOS` container and access the `simpleservice`
on localhost:

```bash
$ kubectl exec twocontainers -c shell -i -t -- bash
[root@twocontainers /]# curl -s localhost:9876/info
{"host": "localhost:9876", "version": "0.5.0", "from": "127.0.0.1"}
```

Specify the `resources` field in the pod to influence how much CPU and/or RAM a
container in a [pod](https://github.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/blob/master/specs/pods/constraint-pod.yaml)
can use (here: `64MB` of RAM and `0.5` CPUs):

```bash
$ kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openshift-evangelists/kbe/master/specs/pods/constraint-pod.yaml

$ kubectl describe pod constraintpod
...
Containers:
  sise:
    ...
    Limits:
      cpu:      500m
      memory:   64Mi
    Requests:
      cpu:      500m
      memory:   64Mi
...
```

Learn more about resource constraints in Kubernetes via the docs [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-cpu-ram-container/)
and [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/).

To remove all the pods created, just run:

```bash
$ kubectl delete pod twocontainers

$ kubectl delete pod constraintpod
```

To sum up, launching one or more containers (together) in Kubernetes is simple,
however doing it directly as shown above comes with a serious limitation: you have to
manually take care of keeping them running in case of a failure. A better way
to supervise pods is to use [deployments](/deployments), giving you much more control over the life cycle, including rolling out a new version.
